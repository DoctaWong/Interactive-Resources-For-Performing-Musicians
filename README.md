# Interactive-Resources-for-Musicians-website

This website was created to help musicians practice more effectively.

I have included several articles that I hope will provide some insight, using the visibility feature in CSS to occasionally quiz the reader, and an embedded video that I hope viewers would find to be inspirational.

For intonation practice, I embedded drones for each key for the user to play along with.  It is recommended that the user records himself or herself while practicing these drones in order to identify areas of pitch discrepencies in his or her performance.

I also coded a quiz in JavaScript to test the user's knowledge of intonation.
