      Different conductors have unique musical tastes and conducting styles and it is not unusual for two different conductors to come up with contrasting interpretations of the same piece.  For this reason, it is important to study each of the conductors you work with.
      </p>
      <p>
      In Phillip Farkas' book, <em> The Art of French Horn Playing </em>, he mentions musical qualities about your conductor(s) that you should be aware of.  These are listed below:
        <ol>
          <li>Idiosyncrasies: The conductor's behavior and general vibe. </li>
          <li>Musical Ideas: How does he treat common phrases, articulation, and dynamic markings?</li>  
          <li>Phobias: What kind of sounds generally produce a negative response from the conductor?  Some examples may include but are not limited to:
            <ul> 
              <li> Sharp and dry articulations </li>
              <li>Overplaying the singers or melody line </li>
              <li> Not enough presence of a particular instrument group </li>
              <li> Legato with too much separation </li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
      <p>
      Remember that in a professional setting, your job is to bring out the conductor's interpretation of the music and not just your own. 
      </p>
      <p> The following are some idiosyncrasies that you may come across with when working with conductors.  Try to think of what you may do to practice before performing for that conductor.  When you are ready to check your answers, hover over the box below it.

      Different conductors have different tastes and styles, and being familiar with various styles can allow you to form a rewarding musical relationship with many different conductors.  The following video: <em> Lead Like The Great Conductors </em> with Italy Talgam, shows the conducting styles of some of the most popular conductors today:
