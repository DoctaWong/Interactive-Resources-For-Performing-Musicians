  <h3> Overcoming <em> Faulty Sensory Awareness </em> </h3>

  <p>
  One of the main topics in the Alexander Technique focuses on an idea known as <em> faulty sensory awareness </em>  (Alcantara, 38).  <em> Faulty sensory awareness </em> happens when we look or sound, or smell different then we really do.  You can probably recall how shocking it was the first time you saw yourself in a photograph, listened to yourself speak, or watched yourself in a video.  Our problem areas are often not what we think they are.  Sometimes, even when we are studying with a teacher, we have preconceived ideas as to what are problems are that we are not able to fully concentrate on the feedback that our teacher is giving us (Alcantara, 178).  Instead, we continue to reinforce the same bad habits when we return home to practice.  It is important to consider when studying with a teacher that we may not be able to see or hear problem areas in our playing that our teachers can.  
  </p>
  <p> In order to overcome <em> faulty sensory awareness </em>, we can follow a principle suggested by Arnold Jacobs, to "use strangeness".  (Nelson, 16) Through years of pracice, we have conditioned ourselves to develop natural reflexes whenever we pick up our craft.  Sometimes the best way to break a habit is to practice a better habit away from our craft.  For example, if we are struggling with posture when we sit in front of a computer, or when we pick up our instrument, we could stand up and take a walk, or sit in front of a keyboard instrument, while being mindful of our posture.  It may easier to get away from our preconditioned bad habtis by focusing on them away from our craft, and then returning to it with our newly developed good habits.

  <p>With the prevailance of recording devices on mobile phones and personal computers, we can overcome our faulty sensory awareness by recording ourselves regularly.  If we do not have access to a recording device, a mirror can also do the trick.  The key is to be able to see yourself in ways you can not from the naked eye.  This is not a definitive solution, however, as we can see and hear ourselves without noticing our flaws, or on the contrary, overreact to them in anger or frustration.  When watching ourselves, we must be attentive and critical of ourselves yet non-judgemental (Alcantara, 165). So the next time you have a big interview or a big audition, be sure not to overlook this phenomenon!  A lot of times we are not presenting ourselves in the way we think we are.  Attentive, critical, and non-judgemental practice with a recording device can come a long way.   And remember, because sometimes we are unable to see our own flaws, it is easier to be critical of others than it is to be critical of yourself.
