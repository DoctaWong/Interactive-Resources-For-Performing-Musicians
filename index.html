  <h2> Welcome! </h2>

  <p>
  Hello and welcome to the Interactive Resources For Performing Musicians website!  If you are a performing musician, you probably know that practicing alone can become dull over a long period of time.  The purpose of this website is to provide resources to make practicing and learning about music fun.  After all, the more we are having fun, the more engaged we are with the material. As a result, we learn more effectively.
  </p>
  <p> Throughout this website, you will find animating images and interactive quizzes that will provide you a quick accessment of your knowledge of the material.  It is my hope that this website will provide a fun way for you to practice your skills and refine your knowledge as a musician.
